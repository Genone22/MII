This is a Python application for performing steganography, which is the practice of hiding secret information within an image. This app uses the stegano library and a custom GUI built with customtkinter.

## Features

- Hide Text: You can enter text in the input field and click the "Hide" button to hide this text within an image. Make sure to load an image first or specify the image path using the "Load Image" button.
- Show Text: To reveal the hidden text from an image, click the "Show" button after loading the image. The hidden text will be displayed in the input field.
- Load Image: Use the "Load Image" button to select an image file (PNG or JPEG) from your system. This image will be used for hiding or revealing text.
- Save Image: After hiding text within an image, you can save the modified image with the hidden text using the "Save Image" button. You will be prompted to choose a location to save the image.

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries using pip:
```python
pip install customtkinter stegano
```

2. Run the provided code. This will launch the Steganography app.

3. Use the app to hide or reveal text within images as described in the "Features" section above.
